{"title":"Make hero, title, description fluid and allow flexible width; keep CTA fixed width; desktop modal full-height","head":"cursor/fluid-layout-flex-width-3046","base":"main","body":"This PR introduces fluid responsive scaling for hero image, title, and description using clamp(). It also allows the layout to expand beyond 480px by centering .content and .main-image with flexible max-widths, while keeping the CTA (.ctaInner) constrained to 480px so “Book Now” does not widen. On desktop, the side modal is now full height; mobile action sheet remains unchanged."}
